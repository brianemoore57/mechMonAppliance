
Building on the Debian Distribution
(Linux beaglebone 3.8.13-bone47 #1 SMP Fri Apr 11 01:36:09 UTC 2014 armv7l GNU/Linux)

We will probably not develop any more using ethernet over USB connection, as it requires a lot of effort only to be
undone. Using the wired or Wi-Fi (Logic Supply's UWN200 USB external adapter with 4" antenna) connections represents
the installation environment best during development. The ethernet over USB may be used for installation during early
development. A mature product will be installed via flash into eprom from microSD. The following assumes a Cygwin or
linux environment on the company laptop/server.

FIRMWARE PREPARATION
The preparation of a new beaglebone black (without cape) requires the following steps:

1. Connect the 5V 2A supply to the beaglebone. Observe the blue LEDs as the boot sequence exercises them. Once booted
   fully, the USB0 LED flashes continuously, about once per second.

2. Flash the upgraded OS if required from the micro SD. Insert the SD and reboot the board while holding down
   the small button on the board itself. This boots from the SD and transfers it onto the onboard Flash ROM.
   Note that we can eventually create our flash image with ALL customization on it.

3. Connect to it via USB.

4. Assigning a static IP address if required/desired. Actual field installs will be static. The connman tool is
   used on Angstrom, or modify the boot.sh as required. This can and should be scripted as the default address is
   192.168.7.2. A different static IP may be desired in the lab, and a final IP will be assigned in the field. An
   explanation is at https://www.howtoforge.com/debian-static-ip-address.

5. Execute install.sh script on the company laptop/server which copies a complete project directory as
    /usr/local/mechMon onto the BBB, including the following:
     a. build.sh - change to a grunt deploy process on company laptop/server
     b. boot.sh - must be configured to run on bootup. Note we have NO BIOS, so date/time DNS, etc must be set on bootup
     c. startup.sh - launches server
     d. shutdown.sh - kills server
     e. company ssh private key(s) so unit can communicate with company cloud server and service technician.

6. Execute /usr/local/mecMon/build.sh - It will make directories, set permissions, etc. It may upgrade the
7. If a cape is to be used, i.e. CBB-Relay cape, a .dtbo file must be insstalled into /var/lib
8. Close all login methods other than ssh private keys (no password login).
9. Test
      a. test that date/time are set
      b. check ifconfig that address is as desired
      b. check that ping 8.8.8.8 works (route is good)
      c. check ping www.google.com works (dns is good)
      d. check 'ps aux | grep node server.js 2000' returns a value (Note another node instance is probably running)

INITIAL DESIGN DECISIONS

The installed node is version 0.10.2, and is required for Express, etc. The angstrom distribution has node v~0.8.02
and will not run the latest Express. Our server will use the built-in service tools to take server up/down, auto-start
(on boot) by file location, etc. The cloud9 environment is all setup to run on port 3000, and is a service that
auto-starts on boot. We will disable that one. For now, we will use port 2000.

BOOTING

The booting requirements beyond what the platform does by itself, include making sure all pins and CAPE devices
are in a known state. So somewhere in our boot process, we need to set them. Since the boot script itself is a BASH
script, I prefer to set the pins with javascript when the server is launched. You will see code in server.js that
initializes some of the pins, but must be expanded.

ENGINEERING TIPS

Regarding node.js, for these types of applications, you may not feel your ajax call, especially a POST,
needs return any value to set a bit. But node requires you to return a value, even from a POST [although
you can use res.send(undefined)]. So you might as well return an 'OK' text string. It is easier to diagnose.
You actually need that acknowledgement, and using the 'success' method in the AJAX call, you can change the button
color, etc to update 'state' in the GUI.

Just for posterity, the procedure to upgrade node.js from scratch on the angstrom distro would follow the following
procedure:

Step 1: Prerequisites - here's what we will need, not how we will build it (we will use flash image)
We will need a compiler to compile the node source. The build requires python for the configuration scripts and
gcc for the actual code.
# opkg update
# opkg upgrade - will take hours
# opkg install ntp
$ vim /etc/ntp.conf
and edit similar to the following
  # NTP Configuration File
  # The driftfile must remain in a place specific to this machine
  driftfile /etc/ntp.drift
  logfile /var/log/ntpd.log
  # NTP Servers for USA
  server 0.us.pool.ntp.org
  server 1.us.pool.ntp.org
  server 2.us.pool.ntp.org
  server 3.us.pool.ntp.org
  # Using local hardware clock as fallback
  # Disable this when using ntpd -q -g -x as ntpdate or it will sync to itself
  # server 127.127.1.0
  # fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 14
  # Defining a default security setting
  restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

Now we need to set again our local zone. To check the available ones, just look into the
 /usr/share/zoneinfo/ directory.

$ rm /etc/localtime
$ ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime
And now we are going to configure the ntp service.

$ systemctl enable ntpdate.service
$ systemctl enable ntpd.service
And finally we are going to edit the “ntpdate.service”:

$ vim /lib/systemd/system/ntpdate.service
And replace this line:
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/ntpdate-sync silent
With these two:
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/ntpd -q -g -x
  ExecStart=/sbin/hwclock --systohc
Restart the board to allow the “ntp” service to start.

-------------------------------------------
# apt-get install python
# apt-get install build-essential


Step 2: Download Node Source
Download the latest source code from the node.js website. At the time of writing it is version 0.10.5 so
adjust this to the desired version. We will unpack it in the current directory. Specify the -C <path> option to
extract it elsewhere.

# wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.5/node-v0.10.5.tar.gz
# tar xzvf node-v0.10.5.tar.gz


Step 3: Configure
At the time of this writing, there is a problem with the Google V8 Snapshot feature causing node to
segmentation fault. Snapshotting helps node start faster and is not a big-deal feature; we will just compile
without it.

# cd node-v0.10.5
# ./configure --without-snapshot
Result:

                       'default_configuration': 'Release',
                       'defines': [],

                 'v8_use_snapshot': 'false'}}
creating  ./config.gypi
creating  ./config.mk


Step 4: Compile
We are ready to compile. It is going to take about a half-hour to complete — go get a cup of coffee.

# make


Step 5: Verify
Now that the build has finished, we can verify that all looks well before we install it.

# ./node -e 'console.log("het werkt!");'
# ./node -v


Step 6: Install
Now that all looks well, we are ready install it.

# make install
